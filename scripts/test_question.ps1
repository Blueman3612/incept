QUESTION:
What is the main idea of the following paragraph?

Bats are fascinating mammals that are active at night. Unlike birds, bats have wings made of skin stretched between their fingers. Most bats eat insects, while some eat fruit or nectar. Bats use echolocation to find food and avoid obstacles in the dark. They make high-pitched sounds that bounce off objects and return to their ears.

OPTIONS:
A. Bats have wings made of skin.
B. Bats are mammals with unique features that help them survive at night.
C. Bats eat insects, fruit, or nectar.
D. Bats use echolocation to find food.

ANSWER:
B. Bats are mammals with unique features that help them survive at night.

EXPLANATION:
This answer correctly identifies the main idea of the paragraph. The passage describes several characteristics of bats (wing structure, diet, echolocation) that all relate to how these mammals are adapted for nighttime activity. While the other options mention specific details from the paragraph, they are supporting details rather than the main idea that ties all the information together.
